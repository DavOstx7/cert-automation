## Certificates Automation

A simple python script for adjusting and validating certificates prototypes and flavors of devices.

### The script works as CLI with the following arguments:

* `-h` -> Show help message
* `--proto` Choose the wanted prototype out of the constant options. Required.
* `--flavor` Choose the wanted flavor out of the constant options.
* `--adjust-mac` Adjust the mac file name to the hard-coded standard.
* `--validate-suffix` Validate the mac file name suffix is valid.
* `--output-dir` The path to the output directory. If no output directory is given, a default one will be created.
* `--source-dir` The path to the source directory. Required.

## System Package

Some old concept I had to implement a bundle of pypi packages, which will give the ability to control both windows and
linux system locally and remotely via shell commands. The basic idea is stated in
the [idea.txt](./python/systemPackage/idea.txt) file. The code is overly complicated and modular. Would definitely
refactor it if I ever touch it again.

# C/C++

## C/C++ Exercises

Some code written in C and C++ back when I was learning & practicing.

## C Learning / C++ Learning

Just some code snippets I wrote when I was starting to learn C and C++. It contains the basic of the basics, and some
practice programs I wrote. I had a lot more programs which I couldn't find (mostly C++ programs after I watched "The
Cherno" YouTube series).
