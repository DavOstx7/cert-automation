#Task is to remove all of the '1' in the matrix who aren't connected to the borders of the matrix.
#Connection is between a '1' to the left, up, right or down of another '1'.
#A connection can be as long as it wants. As long as a '1' is connected through other '1's to the border, it can stay in the matrix. 
#All of the '1's who aren't connected, should be switched with a '0'.
