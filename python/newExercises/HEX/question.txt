The file tryhexdict.py has 4 solution to a problem
The problem is to convert number's between 1 to N in decimal to HEX form.

solution1 is the most simple - kinda cheating with python built in functions
solution2 is going 1 by 1, adding a value of 1 to the last number, and updating the other digits in case it's needed
solution3 uses recursive method, similar to solution2
solution4 is similar to solution1, but the function to turn the decimal number to a hexadecimal one is written.
